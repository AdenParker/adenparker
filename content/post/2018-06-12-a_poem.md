Welcome to my blog,  
Come and read my post,  
I am not a frog,  
I love toast the most.

My favourite colour is red,  
You are the best,  
And I love my bed,  
But I HATE tests.  

My name is Aden,   
You are the best,  
Carrying on reading,  
Because this is the end,  
Goodbye this is it,  
You can solve anything!
